# **Sloucher**

Sloucher is a discord bot for playing games in-app.  
The server that the bot is on isn't open yet, but requests can be made for early access (for developers).

## **Games**
+ The Hunger Games - Move around the map, attack other players, and find weapons and tools. Basically every battle royale ever, but in discord.
+ Battleship - the classic board game.

## **The future**
+ We plan to implement a system for tracking points and more in order to give members more of an insentive to win games
+ More games:
    + Text-based role playing game
    + Card games (?)
    + Other popular board games
    + Other suggestions will be greatly appreciated!

## **Contributing**
If you'd like to contribute, just fork this repository and create a pull-request! People who contriute may get perks once the server opens up!  

**A quick layout of the project:**
+ data - miscellaneous files and directories necessary for the bot (for instance, pictures for games)
+ downloads - probably redundant, for storing downloaded files
+ src - source code directory. This is seperated into seperate directories for each game, and a file in src/ for the game's commands (along with other files that deal with discord.ext.commands. Basically in the main dir, import from discord.ext.commands and from subdirs.)

## **The Server**
The server is not open yet. It will hopefully be opened soon, once we have a few more games ready. Once it's opened, a link will be posted here.
