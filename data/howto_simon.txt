DESCRIPTION : How to play the Simon minigame
#create

#field{Playing the game}
This is a recreation of the classic electronic game.
Use `!simon` to start a game.

The bot will send a message with a series of arrow emojis (which will show up one after the other with a delay between them).
After this, you'll have to react to that message with the same series of arrow emojis.
If you get all of them right, you'll progress to the next level, where the delay between arrows is shorter and the number of arrows is larger.
Can you complete all of the levels?
