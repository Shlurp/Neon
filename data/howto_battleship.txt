#field{The Rules}
Opponents place their ships on the board either horizontally or vertically. There are 5 ships:
+ The carrier (5 spaces)
+ The battleship (4 spaces)
+ The cruiser (3 spaces)
+ The submarine (3 spaces)
+ The cruiser (2 spaces)

Opponents then take turns guessing where their opponents ships are and trying to sink them. The winner is the person that sinks all of their opponent's ships.
